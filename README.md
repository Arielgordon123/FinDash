FinDash is an all-in-one personal financial dashboard,
organizing things such as budget, expenses, savings, investments, etc.

## Features
* Create expense categories (e.g. bills, medical, rent, going out etc.) 
  with expense goals to define a budget.
* Import CSV files from you bank and credit card companies 
* Keep track of expense categories throughout the month
* Look at analysis of your historical data to see behavioural trends

## How to run


## Structure
The current implementation uses Plotly Dash as a front end and parquet 
files as the DB to save financial transaction data. Future implementation 
might move to a proper SQL DB, depending on the needs.
